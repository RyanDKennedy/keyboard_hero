Abstractions:
- Materials -> implemented a thing that stores pipelines and their inputs
- Textures -> just normal textures
- Meshes -> Just vertex/normal/texturecoord data.
- Models -> A combination of Meshes, matrices, materials.

Pools:
- Pipelines -> these would have somesort of data that describes their inputs
- Textures -> just regular textures, or some sort of wrapper around GPU API handles.
- Materials -> these would contain a pipeline and the associated inputs.
- Meshes -> pointers to data

Models -> This would be an ecs component. Matrix for each mesh aswell as a model matrix for the entire model. also stores materials for each mesh.


Somehow get uniforms, maybe have hardcoded types with builtin attribute descriptions and bindings.
Learn vma and get the demos working with vma before doing renderer.
